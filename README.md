- Implements all core [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) features for production use.
- Supports Multi-Raft. Mutliple Raft processes can coexist in a single OS process so they can share resources efficiently.
- Based on [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) and efficient gRPC streaming is exploited in log replication and snapshot.
- [Phi Accrual Failure Detector](https://github.com/akiradeveloper/phi-detector) is used for leader failure detection. The adaptive algorithm allows you to not choose a fixed timeout number in prior to deployment and makes it possible to deploy Raft node in even geo-distributed environment.

## Development

- `docker compose build` to build test application.
- TERM1: `./log` to start log watcher.
- TERM2: `./dev` to start the dev container.
- TERM2: `cargo test`.
