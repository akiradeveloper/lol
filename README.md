## Features

- Implements all basic [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) features: Replication, Leader Election, Log Compaction, Persistency, Dynamic Membership Change, Streaming Snapshot, etc.
- Based on [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) and efficient gRPC streaming is exploited in log replication and snapshot.
- [Phi Accrual Failure Detector](https://github.com/akiradeveloper/phi-detector) is used for leader failure detection. The adaptive algorithm allows you to not choose a fixed timeout number in prior to deployment and makes it possible to deploy Raft node in even Geo-distributed environment.

## Development

- `docker compose build` to build test servers.
- TERM1: `./log` to start log watcher.
- TERM2: `./dev` to start the dev container.
- TERM2: run `cargo test`.
